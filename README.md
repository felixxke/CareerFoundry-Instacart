# CareerFoundry-Instacart

Repository of Python scripts for my Instacart project completed through CareerFoundry's Data Analytics Program.

Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. While they already have very good sales, Instacart is interested in uncovering more information about their sales pattern. We're tasked to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis on some of their data in order to derive insights and better suggest strategies based on their provided criteria.

We are using a number of open-source data sets from Instacart for this project, as well as a customer data set created specifically for this project.
